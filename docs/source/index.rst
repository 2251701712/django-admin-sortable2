django-admin-sortable2
======================
This Django module is as a replacement for `django-admin-sortable`_ using an unintrusive approach.

It is a generic drag-and-drop ordering module for sorting objects in the list view of the Django
admin interface. This plugin offers simple mixin classes which augment the functionality of *any*
existing class derived from ``admin.ModelAdmin``, ``admin.StackedInline`` or
``admin.TabluarInline``. It thus makes it very easy to integrate with existing models and their
model admin interfaces.

Why another adminsortable plugin?
=================================
All available plugins which add functionality to make list views for the Django admin interface
sortable, offer a base class to be used instead of ``models.Model``. This abstract base class then
contains a hard coded position field, additional methods, and meta directives. The problem with such
an approach is twofold.

First, an IS-A relationship is abused to augment the functionality of a class. This is bad OOP
practice. A base class shall only be used to reflect a real IS-A relation which specializes this
class. For instance: A mammal **is an** animal, a primate **is a** mammal, homo sapiens **is a**
primate, etc. Here the inheritance model is appropriate, but it would be wrong to derive from
homo sapiens to reflect a human which is able to hunt using bows and arrows.

So, a sortable model **is not an** unsortable model. Making a model sortable enriches its
functionality. In OOP design this does not qualify for an IS-A relationship.

Fortunately, Python makes it very easy to distinguish between real IS-A relationships and enrich
functionalities. The latter are handled by so named mixin classes. They offer additional
functionality for a class without deriving from the base class.

Also consider the case when someone wants to augment some other functionality of a model class. If
he also derives from ``models.Model``, he would create another abstract intermediate class.
Someone who wants to use **both** functional augmentations is now in trouble. He has to choose
between one of the two, as he cannot dervie from them both, because his model class would inherit
the base class ``models.Model`` twice. This kind of diamond-shaped inheritance is to be avoided
under all circumstances.

By using a mixin class rather than deriving from a special abstract base class, these problems can
be avoided!
